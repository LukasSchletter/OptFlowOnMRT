# General tasks

 - Optimize the registration process. It should be done in 3d 
 - We might want to include the phase images
 - We might want to use ideas from the paper: Image Morphing in Deep Feature Spaces: Theory and     Applications


# Tasks for Lukas

3d registration!

 - files for registration
    + clean up code
    + do some experiments
      * Thin plate splines 
      * Smooth the images --> Learn transformation --> apply transformation on original images

- check out parameter map
- switch to elastix?


 
 - making the comparison of all images
 - experiments with different registration metrices
 - print and read Image Morphing in Deep Feature Spaces: Theory and Applications
